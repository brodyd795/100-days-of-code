# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started working on CSS for the content on my Product Landing Page project from FreeCodeCamp.com

**Thoughts:** Slowly figuring out HTML and CSS. Seems like there are sometimes several ways to structure content in HTML (e.g., links in a nav bar as list items in ul vs. separate divs/spans), but it's the layout with CSS that's still really challenging me.
